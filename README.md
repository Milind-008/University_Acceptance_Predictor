# University_Acceptance_Predictor
The project using algorithm such linear regression, Decision tree and Random Forest focuses on predicting the chances of a student getting entry into a certain university based on his academic and other achievements which are looked at as parameters.

# Background
Getting Admission to a prestigious college has always been dream for the majority of the students. For getting admission to the top tier colleges requires student not only to ace in the previous academics but also present some extra characteristics such as a high score in competitive exam such as GRE and TOEFL and weather has he/she has done research or not. So on the similar parameters his chance of acceptance are calculated using linear regression, Decision tree and Random forest and their their accuracies are compared with each other.

# Objective 
To compare linear regression, Decision tree and Random forest on a large and multi-featured dataset and comparing their accuracies to understand them better. Features in the data set are the student's GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Rating of targeted University, Strength of his SOP and LOR, CGPA, and weather the student has done Research.
